      <h2>About me</h2><br>
      <h4>Hi, I'm Nicolas Diacono — a Systems Technician and qualified Electrician based in Christchurch, New Zealand. I work in Systems Microinverter Engineering, where I combine hands-on experience with technical insight to support the development and deployment of cutting-edge solar technologies.</h4><br>
      <p>With a strong foundation in residential and commercial PV system installation, I've transitioned into a more technical role focused on automation, productivity tools, and test case generation using Python. I enjoy building intuitive GUI tools that streamline workflows and enhance engineering efficiency.</p>
      <p>Outside of work, I'm passionate about fitness, surfing, and outdoor activities. I love learning new technologies and spending quality time with my friends and family. Whether I'm solving engineering challenges or exploring the outdoors, I'm always driven by curiosity and a desire to improve.</p>
